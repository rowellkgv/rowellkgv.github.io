The event is divided by year group, with all players being divided into two teams: elite and non-elite. In each team, there are 3 singles and 2 doubles games. After each team plays against each house, the team that has won the most games wins the entire event. Itâ€™s a very fun event, especially with all the players encouraging each other. Although some people are less experienced in badminton, they still joined due to their house spirit, which is specifically what makes us proud.";

After a rather rough start with the A grade boys, our Open grade girls team stepped up to the platter and performed admirably, finishing first!

Overall we finished in second place, which was extremely impressive - we hope to take the top spot next year!";
